# First Personal Website

[**Carter-haid.github.io/My-First-Website/ v1**](https://carter-haid.github.io/My-First-Website/) <br />
This will link to my first version of my personal website. It is also the first website that I developed without a template. The site was created as a course project for Introduction to Web Design at the University of Southern Maine. (and I got an A!) <br /> Special thanks to Professor [Preston Noon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prestonnoon/) for helping me along the way!
